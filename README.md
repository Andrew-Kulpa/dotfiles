## Why `runcom`?
> [Unix: from runcom files on the CTSS system 1962-63, via the startup script /etc/rc]
>
> Script file containing startup instructions for an application program (or an entire operating system), usually a text file containing commands of the sort that might have been invoked manually once the system was running but are to be executed automatically each time the system starts up.
> 
> Thus, it would seem that the "rc" part stands for "runcom", which I believe can be expanded to "run commands". In fact, this is exactly what the file contains, commands that bash should run.
